# Book Website Scraping

### Overview
I used Python and the scrapy package to scrape data from a demo book website. I coded the spider to extract information on a book's URL link, title, price, rating, and description. As a result, a CSV file (books-scraped.csv) was generated to contain this information.

### Data
[books.toscrape.com](https://books.toscrape.com/)
